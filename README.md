This is a fork of the fork of the original Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer mod for Stardew Valley, created by the awesome funny-snek.

Why the Fork? It appears it may no longer be actively developed. To keep this valuable mod alive and potentially add future improvements, this fork has been created.

What's Included?

- **Fixes bug where host is stuck on the shipping menu preventing the game from saving and proceeding to the next day**
- This fork provides the same functionality as the original mod, allowing you to run a dedicated headless server for Stardew Valley multiplayer, even when the host isn't actively playing.
- Updated to utilize .NET6, as well as makes fixes for SV version 1.6.9+ as well as SMAPI 4.1.7.
- Bug fix for events getting stuck in loop if triggered with "!event" keyword and not followed by any other typing.
- Addition of allowing you to disable the auto leveling up on server activation using a config.json setting
- Detects if you are already level 10, and doesn't change if you are already there
